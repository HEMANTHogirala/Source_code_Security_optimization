# Source_code_Security_optimization
This repo consist analyzing code snippets for security faults and generate corresponding recommendations to optimize them.<br>
This repository contains a Python script to analyze code snippets for vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for optimization.<br> The analysis covers various programming languages, and results are saved as text files in the result/ directory.

**Directory Structure**<br>
Ensure you have the following directory structure in your project:<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/162e7bd1-2379-4bb0-8480-5f694f678e3d)
<br> 
**Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages using pip:<br>
pip install torch transformers<br>
select_1.py Script<br>
The select_1.py script allows you to input code files, select the language for analysis, and get results with recommendations.<br>

**Features**<br>
**Menu Selection:** Choose the programming language to analyze (Python, PHP, or Java).<br>
**File Upload:** Upload code snippets through a file dialog.<br>
**Results:** Save the analysis results in the result/ directory.<br>
**How to Use**<br>
Run the Script:<br>
Execute the script using Python:<br>

python select_1.py<br>
**Select the Language**:<br>
When prompted, choose the language of the code snippet you want to analyze by entering the corresponding number:<br>
<br>
1 for Python<br>
2 for PHP<br>
3 for Java<br>
4 for javascript<br>
**Upload Code Snippet:**<br>
A file dialog will appear. Select the code file you want to analyze.<br>

**View Results:**<br>

The analysis results will be saved as a text file in the result/ directory. The file will be named based on the original file name with _results.txt appended.<br>

**Example**:<br>
Run the script:<br>
python select_1.py<br>
Choose the language (e.g., Python).
<br>
Select the code file through the file dialog.<br>
Check the result/ directory for the results:<br>
result/<br>
└── code_snippets.py_results.txt<br>
This file contains the analysis of the code snippet with identified vulnerabilities and recommendations for optimization.<br>
**Code Analysis**<br>
The script uses pre-trained models to detect potential vulnerabilities and suggest improvements. The following programming languages are supported:<br>
**Python**:Analyzes Python code for common vulnerabilities and optimization issues.<br>
**PHP**:(Placeholder for PHP-specific analysis)<br>
**Java:** Detects vulnerabilities and optimization suggestions for Java code.<br>
**Javascript**:Detects vulnerabilities and optimization suggestions for Javascript code<br>
